Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the discipline involved in developing and maintaining high-quality software products utilizing engineering principles.
- It is useful in creating software applications that serve as solutions to different people's needs in different industries such as communication or commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The research in the creation and development of programming languages.
- The creation of structured programming in the 1970s such as object-oriented programming
- The rise of the internet and agile methodologies, Agile approaches like Scrum and Extreme.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
It can be summarized into these four phases.
1. Planning- Whereby the developer would initiate the project, conduct the feasibility study and determine the scope of your operations.
2. Analysis involves gathering requirements, understanding the essential business processes involved, and essentially understanding what a system needs to do to solve a problem.
3. Design- Involves creating the system architecture including both software and the user interface. Essentially creating a blueprint of how the system would be built
4. Implementation- Covers processes such as writing the code, building the software, conducting necessary testing and eventual documentation of the entire process.
5. Maintenance- It is the adjustments that the developer determines are necessary for the system to be able to adapt to the user's needs

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- The agile method is a relatively flexible and iterative approach designed to be able to adapt to ever-changing needs, especially during the development process, it is best used for projects that are expected to change. There is a focus on the rapid delivery of working software. For example, is in a competitive industry whereby like the mobile devices sector they will release new brands continuously to keep up with competitors.
- The waterfall method is a simpler  method that focuses on step by step analysis of a problem and creating a solution based on that analysis. it is a linear sequential process, but this also causes rigidity in its application, it is better suited for simpler straightforward tasks due to the rigidity in the process. It is difficult to implement any changes once a certain phase is done. For example, during building construction, it is difficult to change the foundation once the building has been built already.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developer has the task of developing and writing the code ensuring there are minimal errors.
- A Quality Assurance Engineer has the task of ensuring that software products meet the highest standards of quality, functionality, and reliability.
- Project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are important as they provide the environment necessary for the writing, debugging and testing of code. (Visual Studio)
- Version Control Systems (VCS) are crucial in tracking the different changes to the source code allowing coordination between members of the software development team. (Git)
  
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Technical debt- where shortcuts or inferior methods are utilized in the creation of software most like due to budget cuts or poor planning or preparation. It could be solved if there are enough resources behind the project and rigidity in system requirements.
2. Constantly changing system requirements- This would cause a waste of time and resources as they could not keep up with the regular changes affecting how they develop the entire software. Can be solved with a well-thought-out plan or procedure that leaves little to chance and can satisfy the needs of the majority of the stakeholders

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing - It is the testing of the individual components that make up a system. 
- Integration Testing - The testing of the individual components and their interactions between the different interrelated components and subsystems.
- System Testing - Testing the entire system as a whole to see how it would operate under different circumstances.
- Acceptance Testing - Confirming that a system meets user requirements through testing it against user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- It is the art of creating questions to gain the expected information when asking AI models. It is done to maximize the potential of the information sought out and reduce the chances of being provided vague or confusing responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Differentiate electric vehicles". "Differentiate the electric vehicle brands that were sold in America and the ones sold in China?" 
- The first prompt is vague and will most likely lead the AI model to provide you with information different from what you expect, it may start identifying the differences between electric vehicles and Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs). The second prompt is clear providing adequate context by mentioning the EVs from China and those from America.
